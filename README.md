# Rock_Paper_Scissors_game_LEARNING
This is a project I created on 9 October 2024 while learning python for the first time, there is nothing new in it just publishing this code to make this remembered as my fourth python project, this code works simply on if, while statements and uses the random & time modules to make this code work, try to beat this game, Thanks for readign!
